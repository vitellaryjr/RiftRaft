# Rift-Raft
a Balatro mod that adds more methods of obtaining Negative cards, or multiple copies of a card!

Rift-Raft adds a mechanic called "The Void". when opening a Booster Pack, you're provided with the option to send any amount of its contents to The Void. this will make it Negative, but you will not receive the card immediately.

once a card has been sent to The Void, it must be retrieved by opening a new Booster Pack type, the Void Pack:

there are over 20 Rift Cards available to do various things to Void Cards, such as creating copies of them, or adding new cards to the Void directly!

this mod also adds ~15 jokers that interact with the content of the mod in various ways (all art drawn by me!)
